# Secure-Password-Generator
This Github repository contains homework 3 from the bootcamp of The University of Kansas.  The final product is a password generator, which creates a random secure password with input from the user.  The password can contain uppercase or lower case letters, special characters and numbers, depending on user input.

## Motivation for the project
The current world environment often requires individuals to have secure passwords to access items such as banking information, website logins, work accounts, just to name a few.  In short, passwords are everywhere and are ani mportant part of our daily lives.  This fact makes having secure passwords critical so that our personal and professional information can be safe from unwanted user interference.  The password generator in this project will produce random password of 8-128 characters each time the user prompts the decvice to do so which makes it a useful tool for today!

## How to use
The password generator is easy to use.  To start the generator the user simply presses the white button at the bottom labeled "generate password".  The user will then be prompted by 5 questions.  The first question will ask how long the user wants the password to be between 8-128 characters.  The next 4 questions will instruct the generator which items, lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters, or numbers, to include in the password base on user response.
